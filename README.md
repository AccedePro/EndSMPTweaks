# EndSMPTweaks
EndSMPTweaks is a Minecraft plugin designed to make ender dragon battles more fair on survival-multiplayer servers.

There is no plugin config file as I attempted to make this plugin as lightweight as possible but there are some key features:

- Everyone will recieve 12000 experience points (68 levels, default) upon defeating the ender dragon for the first time, regardless if you enter the end first. This includes respawning the dragon with end crystals. If you have not done it at least once before, you will receive 68 levels on the first defeat.
- Everyone will recieve 500 experience points (20 levels, default) upon defeating the ender dragon every consecutive time when respawning with end crystals.
- Players raiding end cities that are on outer end islands and not participating in fights are not counted and will not be rewarded with levels if a dragon is defeated.

It is highly recommended you use this plugin with a paper-spigot server as paper enables you to respawn the dragon egg with each dragon death. 

It is planned that I add a plugin configuration file, but at this time, I currently have no time to get this done. Along with other things, it will happen eventually, as well as bugfixes and additional features.
